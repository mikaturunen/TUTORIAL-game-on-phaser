# TUTORIAL-game-on-phaser
Tutorial: How to build games using Phaser.

## Barkanoid
Barkanoid is a Breakout/Arkanoid clone; thus, Barkanoid. It's meant to be an easy introduction into the world of Phaser and game development. The example code in this repository is meant to be as easy to read as possible when following the tutorial I've written up. It tries to be as self-explanatory as possible and contains good deal of comments. The same example can be found in Phasers own example repository and the original is not by me. This fork is redone based on that to better accompany the tutorial.
